# IntrospectiveSort
Introspective/Intro Sort implementation using C#.
************************************************
Introspective Sort also known as Intro Sort is a hybrid comparision based sorting algorithm which uses three soring techniques namely Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort. As recursion depth of Quick Sort increases Intro Sort changes from Quick Sort to Heap Sort to avoid Quick Sort's worst case which is O(n^2). It was developed by Computer Science professor named David Musser in 1997.
